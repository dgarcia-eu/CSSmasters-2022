## Foundations of Computational Social Systems

- Mandatory course in the first semester: 5 ECTS

- In-person teaching with online materials: streaming, videos, **web handouts**, teach center discussions, and discord real-time chat

- Exercises in R (from scratch) to analyze digital traces of human behavior

- Main aim: Learning the fundamentals of computational methods and data science to study human behavior and technological phenomena in the digital society.

- Focus on opportunities, limitations, and interdisciplinarity

- Not just theory: substantial **hands on experience**

---

# Course topics

- **Introduction to Computational Social Systems**
  - Google trends to study culture and development
- **Social impact theory**
  - Testing the division of impact hypothesis with Twitter data
- **Measuring emotions and sentiment analysis**
  - Evaluating sentiment analysis methods
- **Social network analysis**
  - Analyzing a Twitter politician network
- **Complex phenomena in social networks**
  - Centrality, resilience, communities...
- **Emerging issues in computational social systems**
  - Privacy and ethics of digital trace research

# Multidisciplinary student projects

- Main evaluation of Foundations of Computational Social Systems
  - Extra individual points for optional exercises


- Groups of four students with at least two different backgrounds

- Presentation + short report with codes and data (e.g. github)

- Data analysis motivated by a research question that can be documented in *Introduction to Computational Social Systems*

- Coding and project practice warm up for other courses: summer school, data science seminars, master thesis, etc
